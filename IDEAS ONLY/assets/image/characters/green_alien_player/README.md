## Using in Godot 3

### Basic Setup

1. **Import the sprites**: Godot should automatically import the PNG files. Check Import settings to ensure:
   - Filter: OFF (for pixel-perfect rendering)
   - Repeat: Disabled
   - Mipmaps: Disabled

2. **Create a KinematicBody2D or Area2D node** for your player

3. **Add a Sprite node** as a child and assign one of the rotation sprites

4. **Set up sprite switching** based on movement direction:

```gdscript
extends KinematicBody2D

var sprite_paths = {
    "south": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/south.png"),
    "north": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/north.png"),
    "east": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/east.png"),
    "west": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/west.png"),
    "south-east": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/south-east.png"),
    "south-west": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/south-west.png"),
    "north-east": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/north-east.png"),
    "north-west": preload("res://sprites/green_alien_player/rotations/north-west.png")
}

onready var sprite = $Sprite
var current_direction = "south"

func update_sprite_direction(velocity: Vector2):
    if velocity.length() == 0:
        return

    var angle = velocity.angle()
    var direction = ""

    # Convert angle to direction (8-way)
    if angle >= -PI/8 and angle < PI/8:
        direction = "east"
    elif angle >= PI/8 and angle < 3*PI/8:
        direction = "south-east"
    elif angle >= 3*PI/8 and angle < 5*PI/8:
        direction = "south"
    elif angle >= 5*PI/8 and angle < 7*PI/8:
        direction = "south-west"
    elif angle >= 7*PI/8 or angle < -7*PI/8:
        direction = "west"
    elif angle >= -7*PI/8 and angle < -5*PI/8:
        direction = "north-west"
    elif angle >= -5*PI/8 and angle < -3*PI/8:
        direction = "north"
    elif angle >= -3*PI/8 and angle < -PI/8:
        direction = "north-east"

    if direction != current_direction:
        current_direction = direction
        sprite.texture = sprite_paths[direction]
```

### Collision Setup

The character sprite has transparency, so you can use pixel-perfect collision:
- Add a **CollisionShape2D** or **CollisionPolygon2D** node
- For simple collision, use a CircleShape2D with radius ~12-14 pixels
- For precise collision, trace the character outline manually

## Animation Support

This character has 218 animations available in PixelLab including:
- Walk/Run cycles
- Combat moves (kicks, punches, etc.)
- Jumping and flipping
- Item interactions
- Death animations
- And many more

To download animations, visit the PixelLab character page or use the MCP tools.
